   1You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
   1Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
   1down a gully.
   2You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
   2down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
   2To the north lies a snow-capped mountain range with peaks that rise
   2into the sky.  To the south, partly obscured by a thin haze, lies a
   2white fortress with seven towers.  Beyond the fortress, shimmering in
   2the sun, there sparkles a great expanse of water.
   3You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
   4You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
   4rocky bed.
   5You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.
   6You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
   7At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
   7in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
   8You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
   8dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
   8leads into the depression.
   9You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
   9A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
  10You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light
  10at the east end of the passage.
  11You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
  11A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
  11here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
  11says "Magic Word XYZZY".
  12You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
  13You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
  13rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
  13from east and west sides of the chamber.
  14At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
  14passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
  15You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
  15the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
  15staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
  15swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
  15staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
  16The crack is far too small for you to follow.
  17You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
  17The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
  18This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
  18"You won't get it up the steps".
  19You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
  19directions.
  20You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
  21You didn't make it.
  22The dome is unclimbable.
  23You are at the west end of the twopit room.  There is a large hole in
  23the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
  24You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room.  There is
  24a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
  25You are at the bottom of the western pit in the twopit room.  There is
  25a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
  26You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
  27You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
  28You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
  28down to an E/W passage.
  29You are in the south side chamber. A spiral staircase descends into
  29a shaft which has been bored into the rock.  The staircase is very
  29old and ridden through with rust. A breeze blows towards the shaft.
  30You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
  30A passage continues west and up here.
  31>$<
  32You can't get by the snake.
  33You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
  33west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
  33a rock in the room's center.
  34You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
  35You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
  35sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
  35white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
  35Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
  35someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
  3525 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
  35shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
  36You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
  36west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
  37You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
  37west.
  38You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
  38enters and exits through tiny slits.
  39You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
  39the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
  40You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
  40of the hall of mists.
  41You are at the west end of Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl continues
  41west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet
  41off the floor.

  57You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
  57down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
  57up.  The maze continues at this level.
  58Dead end
  59you have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
  59of the Hall of Mists.
  60You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
  60chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
  60round two foot hole slants down.
  61You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
  61joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
  62You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
  63Dead end
  64You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
  64north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
  64going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
  65You are in bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
  65To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
  66You are in a room whose walls resemble Swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
  66go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
  66bedrock block.
  67You are at the east end of the twopit room.  The floor here is
  67littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
  67There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
  67and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
  67wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
  68You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
  68fallen from the ceiling (slab room).  East and west there once were
  68large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
  68passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
  68around the boulders.
  69You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
  70You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
  71You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
  71north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
  71combined.
  72You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.
  73Dead end crawl.
  74You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
  74very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
  74to get back up.
  75You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
  76The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
  77You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
  77seems to open up.
  78The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- Dead end.
  79The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
  79It would be advisable to use the exit.

  88You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
  88west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
  88profusion of leaves.
  89There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
  90You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
  91You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
  91climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
  91passage leading back to the north.
  92You are in the giant room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
  92lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
  92the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "Fee Fie Foe Foo" [sic].
  93The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
  94You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
  95You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
  95over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
  95through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
  96You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
  96the floor with a thick pile carpet and moss covers the ceiling.
  97This is the oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
  97walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
  97passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.
  98You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
  98Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
  98heard.  The mist itself rises through a fissure in the ceiling.  The
  98path exits to the south and west and passes alongside the walls of
  98the cavern, which have crude drawings on them.  The drawings
  98are of animals long extinct and a tiny people.  The people seem to
  98resemble dwarves although some of the figures are considerably
  98larger than those of the dwarves.  On the wall opposite is a
  98large drawing of a castle, complete with turrets and battlements.
  99You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short
  99distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
  99tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
 100You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
 100narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads ne.
 101You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
 102You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
 102from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
 103You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
 103walls are littered with bits of shells embedded in the stone.  A
 103shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
 103up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
 104You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
 105You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
 106You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
 106passages go west, south and north-east.  The remnants of recent
 106digging are evident.  A large sign in midair says: "WARNING -
 106DANGEROUS AREA!" and a smaller one beneath reads: "Cave under
 106construction beyond this point.  Proceed at your own risk!  (Witt
 106Construction Company)."
 107You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
 108You are at Witt's end.  Passages lead off in *all* directions.
 109You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
 109covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
 109upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
 109above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
 109midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
 109for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
 109small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
 110You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
 110sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
 110white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
 110Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
 110someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
 11025 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
 110shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
 111A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
 111below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
 111having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
 112You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
 113You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
 113of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
 113fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
 113overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
 113mist.  A passage goes back toward the south, although you
 113can see to the north what appears to be a large cavern, just
 113discernible through a dense wall of mist.
 114Dead end
 115You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
 115giant room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
 115program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
 115yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
 115of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
 115of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
 115a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
 115are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
 115not disturb the dwarves!",  an immense mirror is hanging against one
 115wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
 115sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
 116You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
 116full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
 116wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
 116corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
 116large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
 116vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
 116steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads: "Treasure Vault.
 116Keys in main office."
 117You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
 117up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away
 117from the chasm into a winding corridor.
 118You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
 118directions.
 119You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
 120You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
 121You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
 122You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away from the
 122chasm on this side.
 123You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
 123heard in the distance.
 124The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
 124seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
 124down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
 125The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
 125roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
 125passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
 126You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
 126active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
 126out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
 126farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
 126thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
 126sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
 126the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
 126sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
 126formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
 126light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
 126gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
 126have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
 126crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
 126gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
 126the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
 126from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
 126ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
 126own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
 126hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
 127You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
 127very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
 127heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
 127a low rumbling.
 128You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
 128oddly shaped limestone formations.
 129You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
 129posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
 130You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
 130empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
 130far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.

 140Dead end
 141You are in a magnificently ornate room that looks like a place
 141of worship for some old and mysterious religion. There are exits
 141to the north, west and east and a spiral staircase leading both
 141up and down. The ceiling of this chapel seems to be made of large
 141wooden beams. Hanging from one of these beams is a thick rope.
 142You are in a room that appears to be a stable for a fearsome
 142animal.  Against one wall is a battered and dirty trough that
 142is quite empty and on the other wall is a huge harness.  Beside
 142the harness is a small window that overlooks a courtyard.  The
 142courtyard is deserted and shows no signs of any recent activity.
 142At the far end of the stable is a wooden partition that has
 142numerous dents and holes in it and you can see that it is
 142securely fixed to the massive stone walls so that whatever
 142is behind it cannot get out.  If you listen carefully you can
 142hear the muted sounds of growling and the scratching of claws
 142against wood.  The only exit is the way you came in.
 143You are in a chamber which is obviously some sort of living quarters.
 143The room is lit, although you cannot determine how. At the far end
 143is a very large solidly built couch.
 144You have climbed the rope and crawled into a small recess in the
 144beams.
 145You are in a dungeon.  The walls and ceiling appear to be made of
 145solid rock and the floor is made up of tightly fitting flagstones.
 145High on the walls are some stanchions for chains, but the chains are
 145no longer in place.  The only sound, apart from your own breathing,
 145is the occasional plop of water as it drips from the ceiling.  The
 145atmosphere is dank and clammy and there is an unusual smell in the
 145air.  A passage leads back to the south.

 152building. There is an opening to the south above which hangs a slab
 152of rock precisely balanced by counterweights suspended from the
 152ceiling.  A notice carved in the rock says "Wizards only, Keep Out"
 152There are some steps leading upward.
 153You are at an entrance to a large room which you cannot see into
 153because of a curtain blocking your view. There are flights of
 153steps here leading both upward and downward.
 154You are in a round cellar made completely of brick. In the center
 154of the floor is a small circular drain, towards which the floor
 154slopes.  Set in the south wall is a portcullis which is so rusty
 154it clearly will never move again. Though the portcullis a small
 154chamber with a spiral staircase can be seen.  An entrance leads
 154north but it is blocked by a large stone slab.
 155In front of you, just discernible in the gloom, lies an old streambed
 155which has been long dry and you can just determine that there is a
 155stone causeway leading across the gap.

 165You are in a winding earthen passage which slopes down to the south.
 165The lower end of the passage becomes narrower and damp.
 166You are in a small circular chamber which appears to be a disused
 166well. Looking up, you can see that the walls of the well are
 166damp and crumbling, but should be easy to climb. However, there is
 166no indication of an opening at the top of the well.
 166An earthen passage leads up and to the north.
 167You clamber up the sides of the well and upon reaching the top
 167find a stone slab blocking your ascent. You give the slab a push and
 167it opens. You clamber through into daylight and look round just in
 167time to see the slab fall perfectly into the floor, so perfectly you
 167cannot see the join.
 168You are in a crypt.  All around you are the tombs of people long
 168dead.  The dust on the vaults would seem to indicate that the place
 168is rarely used. High above you massive cobwebs almost cover the
 168ceiling.  A spiral staircase which leads upwards is the only exit.
 168Brrr! It is cold down here!
 169You are in a chamber above the entrance to the chapel. A spiral
 169staircase leads down and openings lead to the north and west.
 170You are at the south end of a long low attic.
 171You are at the north end of a long low attic.
 171A passage leads on to the north.
 172This must be a thieves den!
 172High on one wall, out of reach, hangs a large bag labelled "SWAG"
 172and a black mask.  The only exit is to the south.
 173You are in a room which shows signs of having been used as a pantry.
 173The dust on the shelves would seem to indicate that it has had
 173little use.  The walls are damp and there is a stream of water
 173running down the walls in one corner. Passages lead to the east,
 173northeast and west. From an archway to the north, stone steps
 173lead down.
 174You are in a long north/south passage whose roof is supported
 174in places by wooden props.  Some of the props have recently been
 174replaced with new timber, but fresh rock falls are also apparent.
 174One of these falls has exposed a fracture in the west wall which you
 174could squeeze through.
 175A smell of decaying timber fills this part of the passage.
 175To the north the passage is blocked by a larger than usual rock fall
 175and the whole passage looks as if it could collapse at any moment.
 176You are in a very low sloping room whose roof is barely 3' from
 176the floor.  At the lower end a trickle of water enters from a
 176tunnel in the west and runs down a shaft in the floor.  At the
 176upper end the roof nearly meets the floor to give a narrow exit.
 176Water drips from the roof making everything damp and the floor
 176slippery. There are no signs that anyone has been this way before.
 177The passage opens into a sizable cave which does not appear to
 177have any other exit although a number of huge bones lie here.
 177Close inspection shows that they are very old and are covered with
 177strange score marks which have been made recently. There are also
 177some droppings which might have been made by rats if they weren't
 177so large.
 178You are in an inclined shaft which steepens at this point. The walls
 178are covered in a thin layer of slime making it very slippery.  Below
 178you the shaft is filled with dark water which surges rhythmically.
 178The smell of the sea is mingled with an altogether more unpleasant
 178odour.
 179You are in an inclined shaft which steepens at this point. The walls
 179of the shaft are covered in a thin layer of slime making it very
 179slippery.  Below you the shaft steepens and enters a N/S culvert
 179partially filled with a brackish evil smelling liquid.  You could
 179slide down here but you could not climb back up.
 180The sea can be seen through a strong metal grill which spans the
 180tunnel.  A quantity of debris is stacked against the grill and pieces
 180of debris are caught in the grill nearly to the roof.  High on the
 180opposite side of the culvert is a line scored into the brick-
 180work with a faded ornate inscription above it that reads:
 180"CAUTION  -  HIGH TIDE LEVEL!"
 181The brick culvert goes north and south. It seems to narrow to the
 181south.
 182Sewage pours into the culvert from a large number of sewage pipes
 182of all sizes.  Those entering from the east, se, south, sw, west and
 182nw are large enough to crawl through. A culvert exits to the north.
 183You are at a junction of 3 sewer pipes which go se, sw and north.
 184The large diameter pipe from the north splits into 2 smaller diameter
 184pipes going south and south-east. You could get through either of
 184them but it does not look advisable.
 185The sewer pipe has got too narrow, you will have to go back.
 186You are at a junction of 3 sewer pipes, which has partially collapsed
 186where a stream enters the pipe. You cannot get past but you could
 186crawl through the fracture in the pipe where the stream enters.
 187You're in a maze of twisting passages through which a stream cascades.
 188DWARVES STORE (NO ACCESS)
 189You are at the west end of a very large and long tunnel. To the west
 189the way is almost blocked by rock falls. Several very large
 189footprints can be seen indistinctly in the dust. High above you there
 189is a huge arrow on the wall pointing east.
 190You are in a very large room with several rock falls at the eastern
 190end. A very large passage goes west or you could crawl between
 190some of the large boulders in the rockfalls.
 191The pipe has got too narrow, you will have to go back.
 192You are in a small, low cavern that is completely bare.  On the
 192walls are scratch marks that look as if they were made by tiny
 192claws.  The cavern exits to the west and the north.
 193You are in a long, low passage that appears to have made by some
 193subterranean water source.  The passage itself is of bare rock,
 193polished smooth by the water that apparently flows no longer, for
 193the floor and walls are quite dry.  The passage heads north-south
 193and bends after a short distance.
 194You are in a large cavern whose roof extends further than the beam
 194of your lamp can penetrate.  To the north is a large opening but an
 194eerie mist fills the opening and you cannot see what lies beyond.
 194A passage also leads south-west.
 195You are in the middle of a swirling mist that eddys to and fro around
 195you. The sound of thundering water can be heard afar off and
 195occasionally quick footsteps closer, but it is difficult to tell the
 195direction of the sound.
 196There is solid rock behind the curtain.
 197You are at the halfway stage on the spiral staircase.  The beam from
 197your lamp is reflected by the minerals contained in the walls and you
 197can see great seams of gold-bearing rock.  A strong draft from the
 197top of the staircase moans and whistles through the rusted tracery
 197of the spiral staircase.
 198You are at the bottom of the spiral staircase in a small room carved
 198out of the rock.  A strong wind blows down the shaft and through
 198a large portcullis forming one wall of the room. The portcullis is
 198rusted solidly in position and clearly no longer moves. A round
 198cellar with a circular drain can be seen through the portcullis.
 199You are at the bottom of the streambed and all your bones are broken.

   1Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
   1treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
   1seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
   1and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
   1you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
   1have to enter "northeast" as "NE" to distinguish it from "north".
   1(Should you get stuck, type "help" for some general hints.  For infor-
   1mation on how to end your adventure, etc., Type "info".)

   1This adventure (Adventure II) comes to you courtesy of Jack Pike &
   1Peter Luckett (R.A.E Bedford/Farnborough).
   1The program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of the
   1features of the earlier program were added by Don Woods (Don @ SU-AI).
   1Queries please to JP or PL.
   2A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
   3A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
   3axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
   4There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
   5One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
   6None of them hit you!
   7One of them gets you!
   8A hollow voice says "PLUGH".
   9There is no way to go that direction.
  10I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
  11I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
  11in the general direction you want to go.
  12I don't know how to apply that word here.
  13I don't understand that!
  14I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
  15Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
  15long description of your location.
  16It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
  17If you prefer, simply type W rather than west.
  18Are you trying to catch the bird?
  19The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
  19what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
  20Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
  21You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
  21like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
  21resources right now.
  22Do you really want to quit now?
  23You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
  24You are already carrying it!
  25You can't be serious!
  26The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
  26disturbed and you cannot catch it.
  27You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
  28There is nothing here with a lock!
  29You aren't carrying it!
  30The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
  30drives the snake away.
  31You have no keys!
  32It has no lock.
  33I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
  34It was already locked.
  35The grate is now locked.
  36The grate is now unlocked.
  37It was already unlocked.
  38You have no source of light.
  39Your lamp is now on.
  40Your lamp is now off.
  41There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
  41probably just as well.
  42Nothing happens.
  43Where?
  44There is nothing here to attack.
  45The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
  46Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
  47You killed a little dwarf.
  48You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
  49With what?  your bare hands?
  50Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
  51I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
  51describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
  51like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
  51up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
  51hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
  51the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
  51object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
  51the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
  51particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
  51give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
  51effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
  51trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
  51trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
  51beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
  51different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
  51distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets
  51you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
  51forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
  51room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
  51Good luck!
  52It misses!
  53It gets you!
  54OK
  55You can't unlock the keys.
  56You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
  56main passage.
  57I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
  57the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
  58I need more detailed instructions to do that.
  59I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
  59things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
  60I don't know that word.
  61What?
  62Are you trying to get into the cave?
  63The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
  63enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
  63looking elsewhere for the keys.
  64The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
  64occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
  64growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
  64various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
  64all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
  64spruce and berry bushes.
  65Welcome to Adventure II!!  Would you like instructions?
  66Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
  66progress is unlikely.
  67Blasting requires dynamite.
  68I'm as confused as you are.
  69Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
  69caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
  69pit leading down to water.
  70Your feet are now wet.
  71I think I just lost my appetite.
  72Thank you, it was delicious!
  73You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
  73minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
  74The bottle of water is now empty.
  75Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
  75nothing exciting happens.
  76Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
  77Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
  78You can't pour that.
  79Watch it!
  80Which way?
  81Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
  81help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
  81to try to reincarnate you?
  82All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
  82                    --- Poof!! ---
  82You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
  82you emerge from the smoke and find....
  83You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
  83keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
  84Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >Poof!<
  84everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
  85Hmmm, I don't know how much orange smoke I have left.  Now let me
  85see.....(rummage rummage).....ah, here we are!  Not much for a *real*
  85reincarnation though, do you want me to try nevertheless?
  87Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
  87me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
  88okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
  90>>> messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "obituaries". <<<
  91Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
  92You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
  93You can't go through a locked steel grate!
  94I believe what you want is right here with you.
  95You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
  96I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
  97There is no way across the fissure.
  98You're not carrying anything.
  99You are currently holding the following:
 100It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
 100have no bird seed.
 101The snake has now devoured your bird.
 102There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
 103You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *really* mad!!
 104You have nothing in which to carry it.
 105Your bottle is already full.
 106There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
 107Your bottle is now full of water.
 108Your bottle is now full of oil.
 109You can't fill that.
 110Don't be ridiculous!
 111The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
 112The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "water?"
 113The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
 114The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
 114although it requires some effort.
 115The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
 116The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
 117Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
 117You'd best take inventory and drop something.
 118You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
 119You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
 120I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >Strain!<
 121I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >Wrench!<
 122You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
 123You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
 124A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
 124this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
 124bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
 125The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
 125promptly snaps shut again.
 126You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
 126blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
 127There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
 128Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, Har,"
 128he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
 128chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
 128the gloom.
 129A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
 129soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office."
 130A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
 130   "This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
 131It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
 131closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
 132The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
 132fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
 132smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
 133There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
 133wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
 133and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
 133friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
 134There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
 134wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
 134in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
 135There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
 135walls of the room.
 136The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
 136threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
 136knives at you!  All of them get you!
 137Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
 138I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
 139I don't know the word "stop".  Use "quit" if you want to give up.
 140You can't get there from here.
 141You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
 142If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
 142adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
 142or "save").  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "hours".
 142To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for a
 142treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
 142partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
 142killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
 142also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
 142explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
 142distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
 142other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
 142harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
 142keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
 142haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
 142it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
 142more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
 142if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
 142how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
 142save paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat
 142the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
 143Do you indeed wish to quit now?
 144There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
 145The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
 146It is beyond your power to do that.
 147I don't know how.
 148It is too far up for you to reach.
 149You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
 149black smoke.
 150The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
 151What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
 152The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
 153The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
 154The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
 154gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
 155On what?
 156Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
 156you come to it.  To get the full description, say "look".
 157Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
 157that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
 158The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
 158back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
 159The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
 160The troll refuses to let you cross.
 161There is no longer any way across the chasm.
 162Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
 162weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
 162scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
 162stumble back and fall into the chasm.
 163The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
 163scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
 164The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
 165With what?  your bare hands?  against *his* bear hands??
 166The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
 167For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
 168The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
 168down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
 169The bear is still chained to the wall.
 170The chain is still locked.
 171The chain is now unlocked.
 172The chain is now locked.
 173There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
 174There is nothing here to eat.
 175Do you want the hint?
 176Do you need help getting out of the maze?
 177You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
 178Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
 179There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
 179falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
 179useful in discovering the secret.
 180Do you need help getting out of here?
 181Don't go west.
 182Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
 183Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
 183You can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
 183machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
 184Your lamp has run out of power.
 185There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
 185explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
 186There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
 186turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
 186He is carrying a copy of Jane's Fighting Ships dated 1693 and a
 186large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've been spotted!
 186I'd best hie meself off to the maze and hide me chest!"  And with
 186that he vanishes into the gloom.
 187Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
 188Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
 188batteries.
 189Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
 189best start wrapping this up.
 190I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
 191"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
 192Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
 192read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
 193It says, "There is something strange about this place, such that one
 193of the words I've always known now has a new effect."
 194It says the same thing it did before.
 195I'm afraid I don't understand.
 196"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
 197You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
 197myriad tiny fragments.
 198You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
 199You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
 199you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
 200Is this acceptable?
 201There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
 202With a flurry of wingbeats (and a loud "HOOT") an enormous owl
 202appears. Disturbed by the light from your lamp he flies off again.
 203A distant owl calls "HOOT".
 204You hear a flurry of wingbeats and a loud "HOOT".
 205You hear a flurry of wingbeats and sounds of a tremendous battle
 205(rustle .. rustle .. hisss .. HOOOT!  scrape .. GULP! .. hoot?)
 206The light from your lamp disturbs an enormous owl which
 206flies off with a flurry of wingbeats (and a loud "HOOT").
 207Nearby an owl cries "HOOT".
 208Owls are very shy creatures. I don't think it will let you
 208anywhere near it. Besides, you cannot see exactly where it is.
 209You stumble about looking for the owl, but it must be sitting
 209somewhere high up.
 210An enormous owl appears from nowhere and gives a loud "HOOT".
 211I'm not going anywhere near that horrible hairy thing!!
 212The spider has eaten the poor little bird. It was a
 212horrible sight, all blood, feathers and hairy legs.
 213The bird attacks the spider and in an astounding flurry gets
 213very messily eaten. It was a horrible sight, a flurry of
 213feathers, hairy legs and blood.
 214You have drowned horribly in a mixture of sea-water and sewage!
 215You are nearly up to your neck in sewage.  Help!
 216The sewage comes nearly up to your chest! Lets get out of here!
 217You are up to your waist in sewage. Lets leave!
 218The sewage comes nearly up to your waist. This is not at all
 218pleasant!
 219Sewage laps about your legs.
 220The sewage comes above your knees.
 221Sewage laps about your knees.
 222The pipe has completely filled with sewage.........
 223It has disappeared in the sewage!
 224Oh! There appears to be an inscription on the spoon.
 225It says EPNS in flowery script.
 226Electro-plated nickel silver.  Its nearly worthless.
 227The chalice is very old and has several holes in the bottom!
 227At best you might use it to scoop a drink from a pool or stream.
 228Bones UGH!  I've got a thing about bones, I will have nothing
 228to do with them.
 229Suddenly, as if from nowhere, appears a little figure.  He looks at
 229you quizzically and then says in a deep voice:
 229"I'll tell you a secret. You can't fly or jump across the fissure,
 229but you might get across by using magic."
 229Then he hops from foot to foot chuckling to himself and disappears
 229into the gloom just as suddenly as he came.
 230It resides momentarily on the slippery surface, then slides down
 230the shaft and disappears.
 231He scuttles along clutching his bulging coat front and muttering.
 232The little horn emits a surprisingly loud sonorous note.
 233I've seen none that would easily come free. There would hardly
 233seem much future in it anyway.
 234Only wizards can do that!
 235Note: This means of travel can generate internal inconsistencies,
 235so take care. Now enter new LOCATION number.
 236As the note dies away the sound of many hurrying footsteps become
 236apparent.
 237The horn emits a loud squeak.
 238Tusk....Tusk....Tusk...      Thats not on the list!
 238Its ivory isn't it? must be valuable.....
 238OK we'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
 239Out from the gloom jumps a little figure.  He looks at you and
 239says in a surprisingly deep voice "Chalice, chalice? now where did
 239I put that chalice?  If you should perchance find it, be careful,
 239for it is said to have strange powers".
 239With that he scurries off back into the gloom.
 240The food disappears into the sewage and the water thrashes
 240with activity.  My, those rats *are* hungry!
 241This is getting beyond the bounds of decency!
 242A tiny mouse appears from a small hole, sees you and hastily
 242retreats.
 243"AH....EGG FOO.....YUM YUM"
 243the giant drawls, and grabs the eggs leaving you shaken but unharmed.
 244The giant grabs your food and bellows  "A MISERABLE MORSEL!"
 244but stuffs it in his mouth and swallows it whole.
 245"FEE FIE FOE FOO
 245FIN FOO OR I'LL EAT YOU!"
 245the giant thunders, and as you cast about for your possessions you
 245are pushed back into the pantry.
 246"FEE FIE FOE FOO!"
 246the giant thunders, and at the thought of foo' great slivers of
 246saliva issue from the giants mouth and further soil his already
 246filthy shirt front.
 247"STAY IN THERE UNTIL I AM READY TO EAT YOU!!"
 247the giant bellows and throws you into his dungeon.
 248This time he gets you. He is now wearing a bib which is even more
 248soiled than his shirt. He opens his mouth wide revealing great
 248rows of black teeth. The stench of his breath mercifully renders you
 248unconscious as he bites into your leg and pulls...................
 249The axe hits the giant, who lets out a roar of pain and rage, raises
 249one foot high in the air..........and brings it down  *SPLAT*.
 250"MY DEEDS!" the giant shouts, "For those you shall be rewarded!"
 250and tosses a large ruby in your direction as he takes the documents.
 251The documents seem to be a set of deeds with some associated plans,
 251but the language is odd and the plans are incomprehensible.
 252The giants hand enters the dungeon and makes a grab but he misses!
 253A tiny mouse appears from beneath a flagstone, sees you and hastily
 253retreats.
 254The flagstone lifts suddenly and you topple headlong into the
 254darkness below.
 255A glowing figure of a beautiful woman appears. In a distant voice she
 255says, "You have drunk pure water from the sacred chalice, my brave
 255adventurer. I come to you as the spirit of goodness, but my power is
 255weak, for the wicked dwarves have stolen the Ring of Orion and have
 255hidden it deep in the Land of Mists, where I cannot go. Return the
 255ring to me and together we shall drive the evil from the caves....."
 255A distant roll of thunder drowns the voice, and as the woman fades
 255from a cloud of smoke steps a horned creature with a pointed tail.
 255"If you have anything more to do with that wisp," he says "you will
 255find yourself in infernal hot water. Just you stick to stealing a few
 255treasures and you won't come to much harm!" With that he points to the
 255chalice and it crumbles to dust, then with a flick of his tail he
 255disappears.
 255A  ringing in your ears seems to say "Will you help me adventurer?".
 256The ringing is replaced by a distant laugh.
 257With you aboard, the unicorn gallops off at a furious pace. The
 257tunnel walls flash past dimly illuminated by an ethereal glow.
 257Suddenly tunnel walls, unicorn and everything disappear and you
 257fly on in pitch blackness. Far below you a door opens revealing a
 257dull red glow and grotesque creatures pour forth and dance and sway
 257as you fall towards the aperture. Your descent is impeded, slowly at
 257first and then more firmly by a web of gossamer threads, on which
 257you can clearly see stamped at intervals  "Made in Fairyland."
 257Below you the creatures leap but try as they might they cannot reach
 257you until there appears our horned fiend.  "You chose the losing
 257side my friend!" he says and slashes through the supporting threads.
 257As you fall you hear his evil laugh and him shout "Welcome to Hell!!"
 257.
 257Now you really are in a mess, lost one of our best agents too.
 257People like you didn't ought to be allowed in the cave, poking your
 257nose into things you can't handle. You'll always lose if you tangle
 257with *him* and there is no way of helping the princess that I know of.
 257I don't think I can stand any more of your bungling I'm going........
 258A swirl of mist rises from the floor. Gosh! its turned into a
 258unicorn!
 259If you are trying to get through a solid metal grill, you're wasting
 259your time.
 260You may just get your lamp though that awkward slit, but most hard
 260objects will not go though.
 261Curtains improve the comfort without blocking the passage.
 262If you're trying to open the rusty portcullis, you're wasting your
 262time.
 263Through the portcullis steps a tall wizard clothed in grey. "Be Off!"
 263he commands, raising an arm. As the scene fades his distant voice
 263continues "And take your belongings with you!".
 264It lands near the round drain in the cellar, slides towards it and
 264drops in!
 265It strikes the globe a glancing blow and slides off into the drain.
 265The globe rocks slightly revealing a small cross attached to its
 265far side, then it rolls towards the drain and disappears also.
 266It lies out of reach on the cellar floor!
 267The unicorn eats the food and looks around for more. On finding none
 267it raises its tail and presents you with a neat pile of dung.
 268A deep voice behind you says:
 268"Where do the eggs come from? There is no goose around here and the
 268owl can't have done it....". You turn round in time to see a small
 268figure disappear muttering "It must be magic again!"
 269The rock around here is very hard and although large boulders are
 269numerous it would appear that someone or something has meticulously
 269removed any small stones or pebbles which could be carried.
 270Exploring is thirsty work, you must soon take a drink or lighten
 270your load.
 271I cannot go much farther without a drink.
 272You have collapsed and died of thirst!
 273Is this adventure a continuation?
 274It is *far* too dangerous to sleep around here!
 276Rest?  Rest?  You don't have time to rest!
 278Ok..................AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!

   1A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
   1to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
   1glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
   1he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
   1you fades away into a grey nothingness.
   2Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
   3I'm terribly sorry, but Colossal Cave is closed.  Our hours are:
